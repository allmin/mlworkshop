<p>

In these series of talks, in-depth exposure to ML approaches for advanced industrial applications will be provided. Much focus will be on ML approaches on Images with a brief overview of other applications. The talks will have three sessions as listed below. 
Prior knowledge on ML or python is not required. Basic programing skills on any language will be helpful but not mandatory.

#	Phase1: 
<ul>
<li> Session1 - (18th Nov, 11:30AM to 1:00PM): Python Basics 
<li> Session2 - (18th Nov, 2:00 PM to 4:00PM): Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning
<li> Session3 - (20th Nov, 2:00 PM to 4:00PM): Image Classification using Deep Learning
</ul>

#	Phase2: 
<ul>
<li> Session1- (9th Dec, 11:30AM to 1:00PM): Python Basics
